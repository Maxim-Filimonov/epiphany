# Auto Steps to the Epiphany

### Customer Development App with ChatGPT

This app is inspired by the classic customer development methodology outlined in Steven G. Blank's _The Four Steps to the Epiphany - Successful Strategies for Products that Win_, which offers practical patterns for finding product-market fit. The book is a must-read for anyone bringing a new product to market.

This app uses the auto-GPT method. It creates a set of personas and simulates product interviews with them. It then summarizes each interview and provides an overall summary. This is no substitute for real customer interviews.

## Persona Development

1. Describe your product and your initial customer hypothesis.
2. ChatGPT will synthesize a handful of customer personas for you.
3. For each persona, click in and have a guided GPT interview with them about how your product can fit their needs.
4. After all the interviews are complete, GPT provides a set of criteria your personas might evaluate your product using.
